# HOL Converter Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Node Shape Mismatches

**Problem**: AST leaves spelled out variables inconsistently:
- Sometimes `%{name: "A", type: :variable}` 
- Sometimes `%{type: :identifier, name: "A"}`

**Solution**: Updated `do_convert/1` functions to handle both `:variable` and `:identifier` types consistently, with special logic to distinguish predicates from propositional variables.

### 2. Wrong or Missing Type Annotations

**Problem**: Non-function symbols like `f`, `g`, `P` were tagged as `:individual` or `:unknown` instead of proper arrow types.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive type inference with proper HOL arrow types:

```elixir
# Operators now have proper arrow types
∘ :: (individual → individual) → (individual → individual) → individual → individual
=  :: individual → individual → proposition  
→  :: proposition → proposition → proposition
¬  :: proposition → proposition

# Predicates have proper types
P, Q, R :: individual → proposition

# Functions have proper types  
f, g, h :: individual → individual
```

### 3. Binder Node Structure Issues

**Problem**: Binders (forall, λ) sometimes tucked bound variables directly under `bound_variable` instead of properly structured nodes.

**Solution**: Added `convert_binder/1` function to properly handle typed variables in quantifiers and lambda abstractions.

## Code Changes

### File: `lib/logic_visualizer/hol_integration/hol_converter.ex`

1. **Enhanced variable/identifier handling**:
   - Added logic to distinguish predicates (`P`, `Q`, `R`) from propositional variables
   - Proper type inference for constants vs variables

2. **Implemented proper arrow types**:
   - Created `arrow_type/2` helper function
   - Updated all binary operators with correct arrow types
   - Enhanced `infer_type/1` with comprehensive type rules

3. **Fixed binder structure**:
   - Added `convert_binder/1` function
   - Proper handling of typed variables in quantifiers and lambdas
   - Consistent structure between parser output and converter expectations

## Verification

All test cases now pass:
- ✅ Simple implication: `A → B`  
- ✅ Simple disjunction: `A ∨ B`
- ✅ Lambda application: `(λx. f x) a`
- ✅ Quantified expression: `∀x:o. P x`  
- ✅ Function composition: `f ∘ g`
- ✅ Predicate application: `P a`

## Result

The HOL converter now produces well-typed HOL terms that correctly represent the logical structure and semantics of the input expressions. All node shapes match parser expectations, and all constants and variables have appropriate arrow-style type annotations.
